# Welcome ðŸ¥­

<img src='assets/me.jpeg' style='float:right; margin-left:20px; border-radius:10px;' width='200'/>

This is a place where I store my notes and ideas, and also a place to showcase some of my projects.

- I have previously worked as a Data Analyst @ [BMO](https://commercial.bmo.com/en/ca/industry-expertise/technology/), where I was on the cybersecurity IT team. 

I view programming as a **tool** to solve **problems**, and I enjoy the process of learning new things. My geniune hobby is finance and investing, and I have been doing it for a few years now. I am always looking to learn more about the world of finance, and using code to develop various financial tools.

- My main language is `Python`.

Before this I was studying at the <a>Lassonde School of Engineering, </a> majoring in Software Development.
